This is the folder the source code for all executables should go to.
Normally they should not exeed a few lines and should just configure/call functions of classes placed in the packages based on command line parameters.

All files that are supposed to be compiled to executables should be  put in the this directory, and added to BuildFile.xml (see inside for examples)
No other files should be placed here!

Hints:
There is an option parser in Tools/interface/optParser.h ;)
It is automatically invoked by the invokeApplication() macro in mainMacro.h
Refer to mergeSyst.cc as a good example for code put here.
