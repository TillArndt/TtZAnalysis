# this is just a list of plots that are plotted pre/post fit as control ditributions
# they will only include: data, signal, background (merged) but will incorporate all 
# correlations
#
# It is essential to provide input plots divided into nbjets categories
# categories can be merged in a second step (see format)
# an optional style file can be specified
#
# comments: # 
# format: 
#    b-jetcat: plotname (: opt plotformatfile)
#  or
#    b-jetcat: plotname = plot1 + plot2 + ... (: opt plotformatfile)  FIXME!
#  the latter if (same binned) plots should be merged to one afterwards
#  here, if categories are merged, b-jetcat must be set to 3
#
# keep in mind that bjet category 0 also includes 3+ bjets
