General remarks:

-> check veto lepton efficiency
-> Apply assymmetry from W to DY (* 0.15 from V-A)
-> Plot mean pttrans versus deltaeta modified by lepton charge*eta or similar (such that it is not symmetric)


Wishlist for new ntuples:

-> Generator info in DY
-> Remove the exactly one good lepton preselection (if there is any) from ntuple writing. In any case there seem to be no events with more than 1 "good" lepton
-> Is more than 1 veto lepton stored?
