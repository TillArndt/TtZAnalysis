You need access to the CMSSW installation on the machine you are running it on!
(AFS token, mount...)

put into some temp folder and untar

(sudo) mkdir /Applications/eclipse

(sudo) move content of untared package there

sudo ln -s /Applications/eclipse/eclipse /usr/bin/eclipse


---eclipse is installed; test if it works



set the cmssw environment

Find out which is the standard c++ include path ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE e.g. with
`gcc -print-prog-name=cc1plus` -v

On the working node:
run the script 'prepareEclipseProject.sh <your c++ include path on local machine>' 


---------on your MAC----------

once run (in your CMSSW area acessed via afs or sshfs or something):

<...>/CMSSW_X_Y_Z/importEclipseProject.sh

..wait a minute

-----everything is set up

to run Eclipse in the project, run
<...>/CMSSW_X_Y_Z/runEclipse.sh

This will not interfere with your local workspace!
