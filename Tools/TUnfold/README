documentation on the TUnfold package:
=====================================
  arXiv:1205.6201

Compiling remarks
=================
 * you need a running version of root installed on your computer
 * very old root version (say, less then 5.20) may be problematic
 * compiling has been tested on a linux system (scientific linux 5)
   it may or may not work on other systems

Compiling:
==========
 * for compiling the examples, type
     make bin
 * for compiling the library, type
     make lib

how to use this TUnfold version in parallel to the existing (possibly
outdated) version of TUnfold which is shipped with your root version

 * make sure the header files
    TUnfold.h TUnfoldBinning.h TUnfoldDensity.h TUnfoldSys.h
   are taken from the local directory when included in your source code

 * make sure the library "libunfold.so" is linked to your code 

how it works:
  the "original" classes of the TUnfold package are named
    TUnfold TUnfoldBinning TUnfoldDensity TUnfoldSys 

  the classes shipped with this package are named
    TUnfoldV17 TUnfoldBinningV17 TUnfoldDensityV17 TUnfoldSysV17

  in the header file there are statements

   #define TUnfold TUnfoldV17
